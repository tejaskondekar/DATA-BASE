4)Why isn’t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?
Ans: 
•	When you select  a table the order of rows in the output, depends on the row address.
•	It will always be in Ascending order of row address.
•	When you update a row if the row length is increasing then the entire may be moved to some other address.
•	Later when you select from table you will find the row at some other position in Output.
•	Its only in the case of varchar that the row length may increase or decrease.
Hence it is not possible to view the first and last ‘N’ rows of table.
